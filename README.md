# Restrictions for non-trivial Euclidean Orientable Topologies

Euclidean orientable topologies:
<br> **E2**: Half-turn space
<br> **E3**: Quarter-turn space
<br> **E4**: Third-turn space
<br> **E5**: Sixth-turn space
<br> **E6**: Hantzsche-Wendt space (half-turn in each direction)
<br> **E12**: Chimney space w/ half-turn

Stand-alone code for testing individual observer location in a fundamental domain, or for determining fraction of points in a fundamental domain that would see matching circles in the sky.

Two files *SingleCloneDistance.py* and  *sampleTopology.py* are base executable files, to be used in conjuction with the notebook *dist_sampling_executables.ipynb* for any of the desired calculations. Ensure all 3 files are located in the same directory.
